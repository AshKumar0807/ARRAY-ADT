# ARRAY-ADT

## Overview

The Array ADT Project is a C++ program designed to perform a variety of operations on arrays. It supports operations on up to two arrays simultaneously. This project offers a comprehensive set of functionalities for manipulating, searching, and sorting arrays, making it a versatile tool for educational purposes and basic array management tasks.

## Features

The following operations can be performed using this project:

### Array Operations

1. **Insert An Element**: Insert an element into a specific position in the array.
2. **Append an Element**: Add an element to the end of the array.
3. **Delete an Element**: Remove an element from a specified position in the array.
4. **Set an Element**: Update the value of an element at a specific position.
5. **Get an Element**: Retrieve the value of an element at a specified position.
6. **Sum of Elements**: Calculate the sum of all elements in the array.
7. **Average of Elements**: Compute the average of all elements in the array.
8. **Maximum**: Find the maximum value in the array.
9. **Minimum**: Find the minimum value in the array.
10. **Reverse the Array**: Reverse the order of elements in the array.
11. **Shift & Rotate**: Shift elements left or right, or rotate the array.
12. **Sorted Insert**: Insert an element into the array while maintaining sorted order.
13. **Check if Array is Sorted**: Verify if the array is sorted in ascending order.
14. **Re-Arrange Array (Negative/Positive)**: Re-arrange the array so that negative numbers are on one side and positive numbers are on the other.

### Operations on Two Arrays

15. **Merge Arrays**: Combine two arrays into one, preserving the order of elements.
16. **Union of Arrays**: Find all unique elements present in either of the two arrays.
17. **Intersection of Arrays**: Identify elements that are common to both arrays.
18. **Difference of Arrays**: Determine elements that are in the first array but not in the second.

### Sorting Algorithms

19. **Bubble Sort**: Sort the array using the bubble sort algorithm.
20. **Insertion Sort**: Sort the array using the insertion sort algorithm.

### Display

21. **Display the Array**: Print the elements of the array to the console.
